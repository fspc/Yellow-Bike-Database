### Automatically adjust textarea width/height based on user input.
#### Non-sucking version, still works great and used by a lot of people with no issues!


The only reason I wrote this jQuery plugin is that other plugins suck. They are wide-spread, but outdated and buggy.

Advantages of jquery.ns-autogrow:

* Grows vertically, horizontally or both
* Correctly handles 2 or more spaces
* Copies more css and font styles to shadow div
* Correctly handles long words on one line
* Flickering can be disabled on Enter
* Doesn't add more than one handler to textarea
* Handles textarea scrollbar if any
* Improved support of special characters

## Download
Run one of these commands in your bash according to your needs.

`git clone https://github.com/ro31337/jquery.ns-autogrow.git`

`bower install jquery.ns-autogrow`

`npm install jquery.ns-autogrow`

Or download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/ro31337/jquery.ns-autogrow/releases) page.

### Options

You can provide multiple options to autogrow like:

```
  $('.example2 textarea').autogrow({vertical: true, horizontal: false});
```

List of options:

Option | Description
-------|------------
vertical | (true/false) - Enable/Disable vertical autogrow (true by default)
horizontal | (true/false) - Enable/Disable horizontal autogrow (true by default)
postGrowCallback | Post grow callback. Executes after dimensions of textarea have been adjusted.
flickering | (true/false) - Enable/Disable flickering. If flickering is disabled, extra line will be added to textarea. Flickering is _enabled_ by default.

There are few more options reserved for debugging purposes. All debugging options start with `debug` prefix:

Option | Description
-------|------------
debugx | X position of shadow element (-10000 by default)
debugy | Y position of shadow element (-10000 by default)
debugcolor | Color of shadow element (yellow by default)
