Setup
================================
Setting up tabulator could not be simpler.

Include the library and the css
```html
<link href="dist/css/tabulator.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/js/tabulator.min.js"></script>
```

Create an element to hold the table
```html
<div id="example-table"></div>
```

Turn the element into a tabulator with some simple javascript
```js
$("#example-table").tabulator();
```


### Bower Installation

```
bower install tabulator --save

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tabulator/3.3.1/js/tabulator.min.js"></script>
