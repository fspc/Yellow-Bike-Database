How to protect the password for YBDB in a public environment.

PROTECTING A DIRECTORY UNDER A WEBSERVER (apache 2.4)

A. The htpasswd command is found in the apache2-utils package.

B. htpasswd  -Bc -C 10 htpasswd test  (note that bcrypt is used)

C.  chown www-data:www-data /var/htpasswd; chmod 0400 /var/htpasswd; \

D.   <Directory /var/www/html>
            Authtype        Basic
            Authname        "Amazing Community Bike Shop Login"
            Require         user someuser
            AuthUserFile    /var/htpasswd
     </Directory>


SSL (do not settle for anything less)

Under Debian:
A.  openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem -days 36500 -keyout ssl-cert-snakeoil.key (100 year certificate)
B.  cp ssl-cert-snakeoil.key /etc/ssl/private/
    cp ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem /etc/ssl/certs/
C.  a2enmod ssl;
    a2ensite default-ssl.conf; (standard on debian-based distributions .. add <Directory> stanza above)
    a2dissite 000-default.conf; 
   

TERMINAL AUTOMATION AND SECURITY

Firefox (IceWeasel):
1. Download KeePass v2 zip - http://keepass.info/download.html
2. Unzip in ~/KeePass
3. cd ~/KeePass; mkdir plugins
4. In Debian/Ubuntu:  apt-get install mono-runtime mono-devel
5. Install KeeFox extension from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/keefox/
6. KeeFox will tell you where to copy KeePassRPC.plgx from into the plugins directory
   Usually somewhere under  ~/.mozilla/firefox/*default/extensions/keefox*
7. When setting up password database for KeePass use only a key file.
8. Add the url along with username and password in the database.
9. Once the login is working properly for the htpasswd setup for apache, 
   the whole process can be completely automated in KeeFox options.
10. In Firefox (IceWeasel) Preferences -> General use "When IceWeasel starts: Show my windows and tabs from the last time"

Chrome:
1. Download KeePass zip - http://keepass.info/download.html
2. Unzip in ~/KeePass
3. When setting up password database for KeePass use only a key file.
4. Add the url along with username and password in the database.
5. In Debian/Ubuntu:  apt-get install mono-runtime mono-devel
7. Install extension chromeIPass
8. Install keepasshttp as explained at https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/ (put KeePassHttp.plgx in ~/KeePass)
9. Follow the directions chromeIPass gives you, creating an identifier
10. Good idea to restart chrome.
11. In Chrome Settings "On Startup Continue where you left off"


DESKTOP STARTUP

1.  LXDE - put a file with this format in ~/.config/auto with name of *desktop, e.g. keepass.desktop:

[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Exec=/usr/bin/mono /home/ps/KeePass/KeePass.exe

2.  Gnome based Window manager, e.g. Mate - open gnome-session-properties from commandline, 
	 and add startup application.

SUSPENDING COMPUTER

Example commands that bring up the gui setting tool:
1. xfce4-power-manager-settings (eg., used by wattos for LXDE)
2. mate-power-manager-settings or mate-power-preferences

There are other things that can be done within the terminal to prevent tampering, e.g., read-only environment, 
but what is above protects the password from hacking, eavesdropping, and from regular users
in the shop, basically, only the sysadmin and bookkeeper should have remote access via the password.  
So while YBDB is on the internet, it will only be available to the terminal(s) you allow it to be on, and
the Point of Sale will be at the proper location which is usually the front of the Community Bike Shop where people
walk-in/walk-out.
