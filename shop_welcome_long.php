    <td><p><span class="yb_heading2">Welcome to the Austin Yellow Bike Project</span> - The Austin Yellow Bike Project (YBP) is a community supported ALL-VOLUNTEER         501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to providing human-powered transportation         for the people of Austin, running a community bike shop, and educating kids         and adults. </p>
      <p><span class="yb_heading3red">This is Your Community Bike Shop; it is free of charge and open to the public</span>, providing a space for people to work on bikes, and learn bike mechanics skills.</p>
      <p>YBP is an All-Volunteer Organization that is supported through volunteer time, parts donations, and monetary donations. Those who use the shop should understand their responsibility to give back by volunteering time and/or cash to keep YBP a thriving community project. <span class="yb_heading3red">We recommend a $5 donation for personal use of the shop</span>, or volunteer time equivalent to the time used for personal projects.  Cash donations are used to supply the shop with replacement tools, grease, oil, and other basic necessities, as well as going towards acquiring a permanent shop space for the project. </p>
      <p><span class="yb_heading3red">We encourage shop users to volunteer their time</span><span class="yb_standard"> toward current projects or consider getting more involved by becoming a coordinator. As a coordinator you can help expand the hours that the shop is open each week. Every thing done at Yellow Bike from sorting parts to running the shop, answering emails, organizing events, creating media releases, and planning for the future of Yellow Bike is done entirely by volunteers. Everyone is welcome to get as involved as they like in the positive work and vision of The Yellow Bike Project. Coordinators can answer any questions about volunteering at Yellow Bike and share their personal experiences.</span></p>
      <p>As this is a Community Space and others will use it after you, <span class="yb_heading3red">please make sure that your workspace is clean</span> and all tools used are back in their proper place before leaving. </p>
      <p>So, find a Coordinator and ask them any questions, have a look around, and enjoy the shop.</p>
