#Yellow-Bike-Database

**Development Branch of Yellow Bike Project Hours and Transaction Database**

The basic objective here since Yellow Bike Project does not host their own version control repository, at least until recently (on December 29, 2014 a repository was [setup](https://github.com/nwilkes2/CommunityBikeShopDB)), is to keep Main pristine, and do development work here, on the assumption that they may want to commit new changes.  This branch is being used by [YBDB](https://github.com/fspc/ybdb), the BikeBike Docker image.
